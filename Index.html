Dear Alisha,<br>
I showed you this, my diary some days back, i never saw you reacting this way, i thought you would just gimme a thumbs up, maybe not react on certain things, but you did, i guess you wanted me to feel secure, i really liked the way you reacted, it really did make me feel secure, it made me think how much you care about this, watching you work so hard to make me believe this, just took my heart, it was so good to see you take so much efforts for this.<br>
This has happened twice now, i am not very good at consoling, but i always feel that i need to do it, two times you've felt low, and i have tried to convince you, you are really very cute after you come back to normal.<br>
It really did hurt me today, you saying tujhe bhi nahi rukna chahiye tha, and tujhme and unme kya faraq hai, i stayed back for you, twice, even though almost everyone convinced me not too, but it all goes away after you are normal, because you are really very cute then.<br>
You looked really pretty today, in pink shirt, very cute, i don't know, if you did or didn't notice, but i was looking at you during the workshop constantly.<br>
I love to put my head on your shoulder, its the best feeling for me, it's very satisfactory, and very fulfilling, i loved the way you were holding my thighs today, it was kinda cute.<br>
I noticed your face today when you saw a snap on my phone of me flexing my body, it was cute and hot at the same time.<br>
